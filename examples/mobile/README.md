# Fintual Design System - Mobile Example

This is a minimal example application demonstrating the usage of `@fintual/design-system-react-native` in a React Native mobile application using Expo.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- Expo CLI (installed globally or via npx)
- For iOS: Xcode (macOS only)
- For Android: Android Studio (optional, can use Expo Go app)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
nvm use
npm install
```

2. Start the Expo development server:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Run on iOS (macOS only):

```bash
npm run ios
```

Or scan the QR code with your iPhone camera (requires Expo Go app).

4. Run on Android:

```bash
npm run android
```

Or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your Android device.

5. Run on Web:

```bash
npm run web
```

## Features Demonstrated

- Typography components (Text, Heading) optimized for mobile
- Theme switching (Light/Dark mode)
- All text variants, weights, colors, and alignments
- Dynamic theme adaptation
- Safe area handling for mobile devices

## Notes

This example uses Expo, which provides a simpler development experience without needing to manage native iOS and Android projects directly. You can use the Expo Go app to test on physical devices, or build native apps when ready.
